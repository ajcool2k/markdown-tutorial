# Why Markdown

- version control
- platform independent
- readable on terminal via cat
- no licence fees
- still readable in 150 years 
- easy to learn and use on every system
- concentrate on writing not on formatting (problems)
- writers can choose a formatting for their own preference without forcing formatting for others
- filesize
- plaintext documents can easiliy be searched
- needed in open source projects
- exports are possible e.g. pdf or html

## What Markdown cannot achieve

- Good spellcheck
- individual formatting
- exact page formatting for printing (paragraphs might ge cut off)
