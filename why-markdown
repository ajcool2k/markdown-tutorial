# Why Markdown

**version control**
- changes can be tracked via git or subversion

**platform indenpence**
- everyone can write and read your notes
- readable on terminal via cat
- no licence fees
- still readable in 150 years 

**formatting**
- easy to learn and use on every system
- concentrate on writing not on formatting (problems)
- writers can choose a formatting for their own preference without forcing formatting for others

**exports**
- exports are possible e.g. pdf or html

**includes**
- source code pastings
- diagrams e.g. communication, gantt
- math formulas e.g. latex code

**others**
- needed in open source projects
- plaintext documents can easiliy be searched
- size of the file is small since only plaintext is included which can be compressed e.g. gzip

## What Markdown cannot achieve

- Good spellcheck
- individual formatting
- exact page formatting for printing (paragraphs might ge cut off)
